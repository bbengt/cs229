This program complies with the spec fully and can also be 
used with any size board.  The program uses a recursive 
method (knightsTour()) that implements the backtracking 
algorithm.  The valid() method checks the validity of a given 
move.  Running the program on a 5 x 5 board results in a 
result set of 1728 solutions, the maximum number of possible 
solutions on a 5 x 5 board.
