This program meets spec in that it saves data properly.  However, when loading a save containing monsters that my game generates, it segfaults.  It loads fine using the instructor's save files.  It also crashes after one game turn after loading a save file.  I suspect this is due to the monster's speed, but I haven't had any luck debugging it.
