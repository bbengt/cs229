    Save and load work, but game crashes if saving with any monsters and after one game turn after loading a previously saved game.  Unable to figure this problem out.

Date:   Sun Mar 22

    Worked on load().  Ran into issues with reading in junk data because I had incorrect sizes.  Fixed and load read data in properly.

Date:   Sat Mar 21

    Started working on save() and load() - moved into io.c.  Also completed first draft of code.

    Further attempts to fix look mode issue, but no luck

Date:   Mon Mar 2

    Tried implementing Look Mode, but it doesn't change the view

    Added staircase terrain type, got ncurses interface working

Date:   Mon Feb 23

    Got binheap_init() to compile.  I ended up borrowing the professor's test code and modifying it.

Date:   Fri Feb 20

    Created character_t struct for binary heap
    Started using professor's code for binary heap; had some issues figuring out binheap_init()

    Added --nummon parameter and initialization of monsters/player

    Fixed issues with dijkstra() & allowed dijkstra() to use diagonal moves

Date:   Mon Feb 9

    Documented code, cleaned up code a bit

Date:   Sun Feb 8

    Moved config information to config.h header file
    Wrote binary_search.c to hold all binary search operations & information 

    Wrote initial version of dijkstra() - works sometimes, but occasionally can't find elements in the queue

    Discovered cause of error finding elements in the queue - I decreased the count but didn't remove them from the queue.  Fixed this issue.

    Rewrote dungeon.c to be a combination of the professor's ideas and mine

Date:   Mon Feb 2
    
    Fully implemented save() and load() functions.  Tested using given sample files and it all worked as expected.

Date:   Thu Jan 29

    initial draft of save() - doesn't work.  Map is now stored in a 2D array of cell structs, which contain the information exported/imported in the save()/load() functions respectively.  Calculation of remaining file size is incorrect.

Date:   Wed Jan 28

    code cleanup - moved initialization tasks to an initialize() method to clean up main() a bit.  Added in stubs for command line switches.

Date:   Tue Jan 27

    Fixes to make hw1.02 easier.  Also worked on code-cleanup and improving corridor-generation.

Date:   Mon Jan 26

    rewrote to be like original program with improvements
    
    This version works.  It's not pretty, but it works.  Rewrote to be like original program with minor improvements.

    added distance change penalty

    rewrote to generate room, then make corridor, then generate another room
    
    not currently working - rooms are generated too close to each other and a valid room can't be created

Date:   Thu Jan 22

    working valid_room() and generate_room(), very rough draft of generate_corridor()
    
    valid_room() and generate_room() are both fully implemented and working.  Number of rooms is MIN_ROOMS < total_rooms < MIN_ROOMS * 2.

    Started implementing generate_corridor().  Randomly select a starting point on a random wall for each room, then print them out.  The next step will be to generate a path to follow to connect the two points.  Implemented a rock hardness.
